This README.md is designed to be the "front door" of your repository. It bridges the gap between the technical code (Flask/Python) and the pedagogical goals (Governance/Safety) described in your blueprint documents.Copy the content below into a new file named README.md.Responsible AI Tutor for K-12A Governance-First, Multi-Agent Tutoring System for Secondary EducationThe Instructional AI Tutor is a Python-based educational platform designed to bridge the gap between abstract AI ethics and concrete technical implementation1. Unlike "black box" AI tools, this system is engineered with a "Governance-First" architecture, where safety, transparency, and policy compliance are foundational to the code itself2.Designed specifically for the developmental needs of secondary students (grades 6-12) 3, the system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to restrict AI responses to vetted, district-approved curriculum materials44, effectively eliminating hallucinations and ensuring content safety.🌟 Key Features🛡️ Governance & SafetyRestricted Content (RAG): The AI is "leashed" to a local Knowledge Base (e.g., LessonAILiteracy.txt), preventing it from inventing facts or accessing the open internet for answers5555.Privacy by Design: Built to align with FERPA/COPPA mandates6, ensuring student data is handled with strict role-based constraints.Safety Alerts: Automatically detects and flags high-risk inputs (e.g., self-harm, bullying) for immediate human intervention7.🧠 Pedagogical IntelligenceDual-Axis Scoring: Moves beyond "pass/fail" by evaluating student responses on two distinct metrics: Correctness (factual accuracy) and Explanation Quality (depth of understanding)8888.Adaptive Feedback Loop:Remediation: Detects low scores and offers simplified explanations9.Fallout Handling: Identifies when a student is stuck (max attempts or idle time) and proactively moves them forward to prevent frustration10.Multi-Agent Personas: dynamically switches between a "Strict Grader," a "Helpful Tutor," and a "Subject Matter Expert" depending on the student's needs11.📊 Technical & OperationalTransparent Logging: All interactions, scores, and latency metrics are logged locally to .csv for transparent auditing12.Configurable Difficulty: Administrators can toggle grader strictness (Easy, Normal, Strict) via a simple configuration file13.🏗️ System ArchitectureThe application operates as a Multi-Agent System 14 powered by Flask and Google Gemini:Orchestrator (app.py): Manages the web server and session state15.Content Manager (knowledge_base.py): Parses the vetted lesson plan16.Evaluator Agent (evaluator.py): Uses the LLM to grade answers against the ground truth17.Tutor Agent (tutor.py): Generates conversational remediation or hints18.Logger (data_logger.py): records session data for analytics19.🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesPython 3.8+A Google Gemini API KeyInstallationClone the repositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/responsible-ai-tutor-k12.git
