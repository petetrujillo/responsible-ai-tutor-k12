**Responsible AI Tutor for K-12**
A Governance-First, Multi-Agent Tutoring System for Secondary Education

The Instructional AI Tutor is a Python-based educational platform designed to bridge the gap between abstract AI ethics and concrete technical implementation. Unlike "black box" AI tools, this system is engineered with a "Governance-First" architecture, where safety, transparency, and policy compliance are foundational to the code itself.

Designed specifically for the developmental needs of secondary students (grades 6-12), the system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to restrict AI responses to vetted, district-approved curriculum materials, effectively eliminating hallucinations and ensuring content safety.

**Key Features:**

**Governance & Safety**
- Restricted Content (RAG): The AI is "leashed" to a local Knowledge Base (e.g., LessonAILiteracy.txt), preventing it from inventing facts or accessing the open internet for answers.
- Privacy by Design: Built to align with FERPA/COPPA mandates, ensuring student data is handled with strict role-based constraints.
- Safety Alerts: Automatically detects and flags high-risk inputs (e.g., self-harm, bullying) for immediate human intervention
